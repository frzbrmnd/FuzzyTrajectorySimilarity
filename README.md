# FuzzyTrajectorySimilarity
Code and materials for my M.Sc. thesis: “A fuzzy method to measure the similarity of semantic trajectories” (Faraz Boroomand, K.N. Toosi University of Technology, Winter 2021). This repository contains the implementation and scripts used to develop fuzzy-based trajectory similarity measures that account for uncertainty and semantic context.
